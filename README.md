## Summary
Our data results should alleviate part of our potential investor's concerns. We can see that average temperature remains reasonable accross both seasons. And the increase of 0.49 in the standard deviation shows that there is only a slight difference in temperature volatility accross both seasons. We should perform additional queries to gather information about the area's precipitation levels, since that is another major factor in determining the suitability of the area. Additionally it may be beneficial to query more months out of the year to ensure our dataset is not too small, and is not skewed due to some outliers in the months of June or December.
